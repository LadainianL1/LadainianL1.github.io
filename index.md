### CPSC 120

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 2 was a favorite because it is always fun creating something enjoyable to play. I enjoy games, so creating something fun yet small was always enjoyable! Creating somethign that used a random number generator was also very interesting. This lab is a small guessing game that the user has to use to guess a number 1-10 that is randomly picked. This is also one of my final lab I have done for my first semester of college, it will be memorable as it was fun to work with my partner on this project. 

* Lab 2
    Lab 2 was probably the first piece of code that I have written, ever. It was an easy word game that required the user to use two nouns and one verb, one of the nouns would be plural. This was fun as it was a completely new experience for me as I have had zero experience up to that point of programming. Also, the process of working together with someone to create somethign was fun as well, it took collaboration, communication, and problem solving to create this program. 

* Lab 3
    Lab 3, part 2 was interesting as it connected mathematic equations and concepts to create a BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) calculator. With little experience up to this point, it was a challenge that was placed onto my partner and me. However, we were able to work our way patiently to create the program. It was a challenge as I had to find ways to work with mathematical equations and apply them into the program; however, the product was a reliable calculator that I could see myself using in the future.
